## What It Is

A done-for-you review monitoring and response service for restaurants and hospitality businesses. We track every review across Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and social media — then draft on-brand responses delivered in a daily digest.

## Target Customer

Restaurants and hospitality businesses with 2-10 locations. Too busy to track reviews, too small for an agency.

## Revenue Model

Monthly subscriptions:
- **Starter** $299/mo — Google + Yelp, daily digest, draft responses
- **Growth** $599/mo — All platforms + competitors + weekly report (Most Popular)
- **Premium** $999/mo — Everything + we post on your behalf + monthly strategy call

## Sales Strategy

**Lead magnet:** Free Review Audit — we scan their reviews and show them every unanswered one from the last 30 days. Creates urgency.

**Acquisition channels:**
- Cold email outreach to restaurant owners
- Free audit requests from the website
- Eventually: SEO, referrals, partnerships with restaurant consultants

## Goals

- [ ] Deploy site to Vercel + connect replypulse.io
- [ ] Hook up contact form (Formspree)
- [ ] Build free audit generator (scrape Google/Yelp reviews for a given restaurant)
- [ ] Create cold outreach email templates
- [ ] Land first paying client
- [ ] Build delivery pipeline (daily digest system for active clients)
- [ ] 5 clients → $1,500-3,000/mo
- [ ] 20 clients → $6,000-12,000/mo

## Costs

- Domain: ~$30/yr
- Hosting: Free (Vercel)
- Email: TBD (probably Google Workspace ~$7/mo for hello@replypulse.io)
- API costs for scraping: Minimal
