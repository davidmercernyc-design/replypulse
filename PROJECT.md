## What It Is

RepWatch watches your business reputation so you don't have to.

**Simple:** We scan Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and social media. You get an alert only when something needs attention.

**Clear:** See your Reputation Score at a glance. Track competitors. Know exactly where you stand.

**Insurance:** One bad review can go viral and cost you thousands. $79/mo is cheap protection.

## The Pitch

> "We watch your reputation so you don't have to. One bad review can cost $10k — we cost $79/mo."

## Target Customer

Local businesses (restaurants, salons, clinics, auto shops, gyms, etc.) with 1-10 locations. Too busy to check every platform manually.

## Pricing (Simple & Clear)

- **Starter** $79/mo — Monitor Google + Yelp, alerts when you get a bad review, AI-drafted response you can copy-paste
- **Growth** $149/mo — All platforms + priority support
- **Premium** $349/mo — Everything + multi-location + priority support
